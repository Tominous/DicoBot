# WhatsApp DicoBot

WhatsApp DicoBot is a dictionary bot powered by Twilio WhatsApp API and Oxford Dictionary API ðŸ¤– that enhances your messaging experience.

When you search a word, you get the word meaning and it's usage. It's so fast and on point. This is how to beat your grammarian friends who bombard you with jaw threatening words. :laughing:
